Quantum Fair Machine Learning,"In this paper, we inaugurate the field of quantum fair machine learning. We undertake a comparative analysis of differences and similarities between classical and quantum fair machine learning algorithms, specifying how the unique features of quantum ..."
Evaluating manufacturing machine control language standards: an implementer's view,The focus of this paper is: how can standards for manufacturing machine control languages be evaluated? What is required of a standard defining one of these languages so that implementations will interoperate? The paper provides a set of specific ...
Machine Learning @ Amazon,"In this talk, I will first provide an overview of the key Machine Learning (ML) applications we are developing at Amazon. I will then describe a matrix factorization model that we have developed for making product recommendations âĂŞ the salient ..."
A Data Slicing Method to Improve Machine Learning Model Accuracy in Bankruptcy Prediction,"High-accuracy bankruptcy prediction has been important to investors and corporate finance officers for decades. With bankruptcy data in China and Poland given, this paper is an exploratory study attempting to aid feature engineering in bankruptcy ..."
Security engineering for machine learning (keynote),"Machine Learning appears to have made impressive progress on many tasks including image classification, machine translation, autonomous vehicle control, playing complex games including chess, Go, and Atari video games, and more. This has led to much ..."
Machine Learning in Tourism,"Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence, which is a process of learning from different types of data to make accurate predictions. Data in tourism is various such as Statistics, Photos, Maps, and Texts. Also, each tourism cycle has ..."
Human-Machine Interface System for pre-Diagnosis of Diseasesusing Machine Learning,"The rapid growth of applications of latest information technology into the field of medical sciences have founded the idea to develop such a platform through which pre-diagnosis of diseases could be easy, efficient and less time consuming. This paper ..."
Who Should Pay When Machines Cause Harm? Laypeople’s Expectations of Legal Damages for Machine-Caused Harm,The question of who should be held responsible when machines cause harm in high-risk environments is open to debate. Empirical research examining laypeople’s opinions has been largely restricted to the moral domain and has only inspected a limited set ...
Vers la complétude interactive: exigences pour une machine abstraite orientée interaction: Toward Interactive Completeness: Requirements for an Interactive Abstract Machine,Turing’s work on computability served as the founding theoretical framework for computer science. It aimed at formalizing the intuitive notion of algorithm and gave birth to the concepts of logical automaton and abstract machine. The latter are used to ...
Machine learning for hybrid machine translation,We describe a substitution-based system for hybrid machine translation (MT) that has been extended with machine learning components controlling its phrase selection. The approach is based on a rule-based MT (RBMT) system which creates template ...
Integrated Reproducibility with Self-describing Machine Learning Models,"Researchers and data scientists frequently want to collaborate on machine learning models. However, in the presence of sharing and simultaneous experimentation, it is challenging both to determine if two models were trained identically and to reproduce ..."
MLMI '18: Proceedings of the 2018 International Conference on Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence,"MLMI 2018 provides a scientific platform for both local and international scientists, engineers and technologists who work in all aspects of Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence to exchange latest research results. In addition to the contributed ..."
Machine learning in the real world,"Machine Learning (ML) has become a mature technology that is being applied to a wide range of business problems such as web search, online advertising, product recommendations, object recognition, and so on. As a result, it has become imperative for ..."
Multimodal interactive machine translation,"Interactive machine translation (IMT) [1] is an alternative approach to machine translation, integrating human expertise into the automatic translation process. In this framework, a human iteratively interacts with a system until the output desired by ..."
MLMI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 2nd International Conference on Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence,"2019 2nd International Conference on Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence (MLMI 2019) was held in Jakarta, Indonesia during September 18-20, 2019. It is a comprehensive conference which focuses on Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence. The ..."
Putting Machine Learning into Production Systems: Data validation and software engineering for machine learning,Breck et al. share details of the pipelines used at Google to validate petabytes of production data every day. With so many moving parts it’s important to be able to detect and investigate changes in data distributions before they can impact model ...
Machine transcoding,"There are grounds for questioning whether translation done by computer should resemble closely, either in process or in product, translation done manually. Several workers in machine translation have proposed radical departures from the naively adopted ..."
Exploitation of Machine Learning Techniques in Modelling Phrase Movements for Machine Translation,"We propose a distance phrase reordering model (DPR) for statistical machine translation (SMT), where the aim is to learn the grammatical rules and context dependent changes using a phrase reordering classification framework. We consider a variety of ..."
Research on Diabetes Prediction Based on Machine Learning,"Diabetes is an irreversible, chronic metabolic disease, and is now the third most important non-communicable disease threatening human health. Therefore, early diagnosis of diabetes is essential. In this paper, after preprocessing the Pima Indian ..."
Machine Learning for the Developing World,"Researchers from across the social and computer sciences are increasingly using machine learning to study and address global development challenges. This article examines the burgeoning field of machine learning for the developing world (ML4D). First, ..."
