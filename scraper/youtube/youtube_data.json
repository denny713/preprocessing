The truth is one would have to have a vast amount of understanding of what you're even talking about to even follow you if in fact we were starting from 0  to hero. You truly don't explain even one detail of what you're actually showing us on the screen. But after watching many times only, and I repeat only if the individual really really really really bends over backward for your word salad can they eventually figure out more or less at least the concept. But ur truly not giving any of in in baby steps. It' all like and advanced example of what you think is a basic demo. But no average person would ever be able to get it. You're literally stunting the entire world if they are actually wanting to start coding. Literally one of the worst teachers I have ever witnessed in my entire natural life. But that being said thanks to myself and none other I finally was able to figure out some of it. Gosh I hate videos like these. But it's all we have. Never the less thanks for at least trying.",
